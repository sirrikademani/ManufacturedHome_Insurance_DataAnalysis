# ManufacturedHome_Insurance_DataAnalysis

For a mnaufactured home insurance company ABC to be successful, we need to identify multiple key metrics and insights based on
 the customer and the policies associated with the customer. These key metrics and insights will
 help us pinpoint the areas that we would want to focus our growth efforts along with finding parts
 of the business that we need to improve on. The more areas we can find that are creating major
 profits/deficits in our company, the more efficient we can make each department of the
 company.

## Agenda :
 ### Data Analysis:
 > 1. Extract the data, transform, and load it into a database of your choice.
 > 2. Create key metrics and insights in the visualization tool of your choice based on
 the data
 > 3. Report your findings
